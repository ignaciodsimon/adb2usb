Note by Joe, November 2019.

These two files:

	USBHID.cpp
	USBHID.h

were modified to add an overload of begin() that accepts the vendor, product, manufacturer ... IDs. I modified them in the directory:

	/Users/myUser/Library/Arduino15/packages/stm32duino/hardware/STM32F1/2019.10.9/libraries/USBComposite

Maybe there's a way of doing it without modifying these files, but this was just easy and fast.

These file:

	Keyboard.cpp

Was modified to include two new functions:

	pressKeycode()
	releaseKeycode()

That send directly the keycode, instead of accepting an ASCII character and converting it. It's useful for the more "special" keystrokes.
